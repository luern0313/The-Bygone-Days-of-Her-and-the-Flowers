<p>After the Traveler, Nahida, and their companions resolved the crisis in Sumeru City, Nahida remained dedicated to the nation's governance, and under her leadership, Sumeru improved with each passing day.<br/>
However, a new crisis has arisen. Frequent tremors signal an unprecedented disaster that threatens to engulf all of Teyvat. Nahida suspects that the Irminsul is once again plagued by illness.<br/>
In a moment of helplessness, a strange sensation leads her to a mysterious room…</p>

<p>One day, you and Paimon receive an invitation from Nahida for a vacation. Along with Alhaitham and Dehya, you touch a peculiar canister of knowledge and find yourselves transported to Sumeru's past, as stored within the canister.<br/>
But during the Sabzeruz Festival, strange events begin to unfold. Odd dreams, bizarre murders, familiar yet foreign faces, and a nation without its god… "Is this… really Sumeru?"<br/>
Explore this unknown world, uncover the truth behind the murder and the frequent tremors; and perhaps, meet her once again…<br/>
Finally, save the world, and unravel the secrets of the Irminsul and all of Teyvat.</p>
